# Nathan Briers Forkify Project 

## Introduction

Forkify is a fun meal planner that enables users to do the following things:
- Search for recipes based on specific keywords, e.g. 'cheese', 'pasta', 'pizza'
- Scroll through the different pages of recipe search results
- Click on an individual recipe to view more details:
    - Time to cook
    - Servings (customisable)
    - Ingredients (can be incremented based on the number of servings chosen )
    - How to cook
- Users can also choose to bookmark specific recipes they find particularly interesting, adding them to a dropdown list in the top-right corner
- Add their own recipes, which will only be viewable by the person who created them. Added recipes also appear with a custom icon next to them
- Bookmarks and added recipes are stored between page refreshes via local storage

Currently the application is in it's MVP (minimum viable product) as per Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy, but I intend to add additional features and functionalities in the future.

Again all credit goes to Jonas Schmedtmann for this project.
